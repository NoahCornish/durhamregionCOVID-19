# Durham Region COVID-19 Data
In this repository you can access the shapefile I use to map the data as well as the CSV file I continue to update daily.  
The repository now includes the vaccination data for the region.  It will be updated daily as well.
This data has been complied from the Durham Region COVID-19 Tracker and the Open Data site from the Region of Durham (Shapefiles).

NOTE:
Durham VOCs Positivity file will be updated on Wednesday's to avoid extreme daily changes which have been occuring.


All other files will be updated daily
